## Notes

The most time consuming thing was making the questions and adding the images, but it was fun. I was challenged trying to do the flip animation and the randomization for the next button. I also had to refresh my memory on ternary operators too to challenge myself. Unlike last week, this week I tried to break down this site into many components rather than cramming everything into the App.jsx. Overall, the main components of the site were easy to implement but polishing, structuring, and styling really was quite difficult.
